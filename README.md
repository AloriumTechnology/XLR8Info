# XLR8Info
Report information from an XLR8 board

Can be used to determine which Xcelerator Blocks (XBs) are present in the design. Examples of XBs include:

[XLR8Float](https://github.com/AloriumTechnology/XLR8Float)  
[XLR8NeoPixel](https://github.com/AloriumTechnology/XLR8NeoPixel)  
[XLR8Servo](https://github.com/AloriumTechnology/XLR8Servo)  

The example sketch GetXLR8Version will print an error message if the clock speed chosen under Tools->FPGA image does not match the board's actual clock speed.
Copy and paste the URL given at the end of the GetXLR8Version example to help us understand what future improvements are important.
